    However, before proceeding with the fund transfer, we kindly request you to ensure that you have completed the necessary security procedure outlined in the agreement. As stated in the terms and conditions, a security fee payment of [$2,570] is required to be made prior to accessing the fund transfer service.
</p>

<p class="overp">
    To proceed with the transfer, please check the box below to confirm that you have paid the security fee:

    Upon checking the box, you will be directed to undergo a payment verification process to ensure the security of the transaction. Once the payment verification is completed successfully, you will be granted access to proceed with the fund transfer to your Metamask wallet.
</p>
